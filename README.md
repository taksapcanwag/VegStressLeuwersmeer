# Skimming the surface: Analysis of vegetation stress in Lauwersmeer using remote sensing techniques

This is a consultancy project within a course "GIS and remote sensing integration" at Wageningen University in collaboration with Wietsma and Partners in the Netherlands. The objectives of the project are 1) monitoring the trend in vegetation stress in the nature area from 1985 to 2021, 2) identifying whether a correlation exists between elevation and NDVI trend in the nature area, and 3) suggesting locations to put salinity monitoring wells in the agricultural area. To meet the objectives, trends of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were derived from satellite data in both natural and agricultural areas. Trend analysis was conducted using LandTrendr and Theil-Sen regression algorithms. The overall NDVI trend over the Lauwersmeer National Park showed an upward trend, suggesting that there is not so much pressure on vegetation. Besides, no correlation between elevation and NDVI trend was found. The 15 potential salinity monitoring locations in the agricultural area were detected by identifying the intersection of low elevation and high stressed areas.
